pause
cls
echo Tammy: Im soaked...
pause
cls
echo Male Student 2: Why cant you watch where youre going?
pause
cls
echo Female Student: Haha! Her clothes are soaked!
pause
cls
echo By college you wouldve expect her grade school bullies to mature.
echo But this became a common occurrence as of lately.
pause
cls
echo Tammy: You.. Idiots.. 
pause
cls
echo Tammy: Why cant you watch where youre throwing stuff! 
echo Why even through milk to begin with?                  
echo Youve had more than 4 years to grow up, but instead
echo Take every opportunity to act-
pause

echo Male Student: What? You take everything so seriously! 
pause

echo Tammy *Thinking*: My birthday is pretty much ruined
echo I smell like milk and look even worse.
pause 
cls
echo  *Thinking*: Why even bother with these classes,
echo Honestly I could just drop out. 
echo My parents wealth could support me till the day I die.
pause 
cls
echo *Thinking*: Its not like I have any friends
echo Or a cute guy to look at in class either.
pause 
cls
echo Tammy contemplated life for a moment, school, family
echo What good is it all?
pause 
cls
Color 08
echo She took the opportunity to stare out the window.
pause 
cls
echo She had seen many sights in her life
echo But this particular view calms her more than anything.
pause 
cls
echo There laid a beautiful pond where kids fed the ducks.
echo People frequently visit it due to its calm atmosphere. 
echo Large trees usually hid the park but 
echo Being on the 3rd floor helped her see things
echo She could have never seen anywhere else.
pause 
cls
echo The forest stretched on for a while it seemed.
echo She wondered how long it would take to jog around the area
echo Though she has never been the athletic type.
pause 
cls
echo She stared at the center of the forest
echo The trees covered most of the ground,
echo But there was a small piece of land where the sun shone.
pause 
cls
echo Looking at it even closer she began to see things unfold.
pause 
cls
echo A fire, a fire that began to grow and grow
echo Trees falling down and the city going into panic.
pause 
cls
echo She had no time to react when she realized 
echo What was unfolding was real.
pause 
cls
echo As quick as it began, a small figure in the fire released
echo A spark of light. A giant explosion occured shaking 
echo The entire building.
pause 
cls
echo There was no time to stare anymore
echo She fell out of her seat and began to yell-
pause 
cls
echo Tammy: What is that!? A nuke? 
echo We need to get to safety and-
pause
cls
echo She opened her eyes and stood from the floor. 
echo The students looked at each other, clueless as 
echo To why she was screaming.
pause 
cls
echo Tammy had realized, what had just occured was fake somehow.
echo The outside is the same as it had been a few minutes ago.
echo But the destruction so real she could feel the shaking
echo From the classroom.
pause 
cls
echo Student: Pfft-
pause 
cls
echo Everyone began laughing so hard they couldnt contain themselves.
pause 
cls
echo Male Student: What kind of sci-fi movies have you been watching!?
pause 
cls
echo Tammy: What?! I saw what I saw! Did anyone else see that explosion?!
pause 
cls
echo Female Student: *looking at phone* That explosion
echo was a 4.6 magnitude earthquake.
pause 
cls
echo Tammy: Huhh!?!
pause 
cls
echo Professor: Were no stranger to earthquakes. Settle down.
pause 
cls
echo Tears began forming, she saw something no one else had.
echo Or maybe they just werent looking. 
echo Once again she had become the laughing stock for everyone.
pause 
cls
echo The bell rung and she stormed out of class.
pause 
cls
echo Going through the hall was worse than she wouldve expected.
pause 
cls
echo Male Student: And this girl said- a nuke!
pause 
cls
echo Male Student 2: No way, seriously!
pause 
cls
echo Female Student: But how on Earth can you mistake the two?
pause 
cls
echo Female Student 2: People are saying she suffers from some
echo Kind of illness, like, with her brain!
pause 
cls
echo She pushed her way out of the school and
echo began to walk to the forest
pause 
cls
echo Tammy: If they dont believe me, then I just have to prove it!
pause 
cls
echo Suddenly she felt a jolt in her body.
pause 
cls
Color 02
echo Tammy *Thinking*: Theres no doubt what I saw was real, but-
pause 
cls
echo Tammy *Thinking*: Wouldnt going there, subject me to the
echo Same danger I saw? 
pause 
cls
echo She stopped infront of the forest and thought a while about it.
pause 
cls
echo Tammy *Thinking*: Well, I made up my mind. If I'm going to do 
echo It, I have to be back in time for the Cafe!
